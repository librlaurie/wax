# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

You will need Ruby 2.2 or higher and [Bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) installed.

You can check your Ruby version with `$ ruby --version` and can install Bundler with `$ gem install bundler`. Having trouble? Check out these guides for configuring your machine to use Jekyll for [Mac](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/install-jekyll-on-os-x/), [Linux](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/install-jekyll-on-linux/), and [Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/).

## Installing

Install `wax_theme` globally with `$ gem install wax_theme` or add it to your site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '~> 3.7'
gem 'wax_theme'

group :development, :test do
 gem 'wax_tasks' # optional
end

```

and run `$ bundle install`. If you want to use custom Rake tasks for generating pages, IIIF derivatives, a search index, and more, you should add `wax_tasks` to your `Gemfile` as well.

> __Hint:__ The best way to get started is to clone the site demo:
>
> `$ git clone https://github.com/minicomp/wax.git -b gh-pages`
